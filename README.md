gdsc recruitment tasks
Started on the task2 for the cybersec domain.
Firstly I downloaded the image.
Having played a lot of ARGs (Alternate Reality Games) my first thought was to open this in notepad.
And voila! the first line of the text had this: "We will We will ... you"
This is a line from the famous song by the band queen: We will rock you.
maybe that is the message?
maybe, maybe not. Is there something related to rock?
more investigation is needed.
