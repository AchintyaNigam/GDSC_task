gdsc recruitment tasks
Started on the task2 for the cybersec domain.
Firstly I downloaded the image.
Having played a lot of ARGs (Alternate Reality Games) my first thought was to open this in notepad.
And voila! the first line of the text had this: "We will We will ... you"
This is a line from the famous song by the band queen: We will rock you.
maybe that is the message?
maybe, maybe not. Is there something related to rock?
more investigation is needed.

10:58PM:
I found a new file using binwalk called "snowyrockk.txt"
but it is encrypted and I need a password.
using zsteg I know that there is a file called "PGP secret key" I don't know how to extract it though. But it probably contains the password.
